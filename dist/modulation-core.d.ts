/**
 * The modulation layer's shared ground — types, palette, math, and the
 * modulator-type registry, all framework-neutral.
 *
 * A modulation lives in one of 16 slots, one per Move sequencer step button:
 * touch a control and press a step to create the modulation there and wire
 * the control to it. Each slot carries a modulator (an LFO, an envelope
 * follower, a curve...) and a palette colour; the same colour marks the
 * slot's circle in the track row and a dot on every control it drives.
 *
 * The modulated value NEVER enters the TweakStore: a control keeps the
 * number the user set (the base), and the modulation is a live layer read
 * at frame time through the ModulationStore. That keeps presets, the
 * persistence shelf, and the bridge kit's diffing on the stored value —
 * nothing loops, nothing thrashes — the same shape Pixture's audio mods
 * proved out.
 *
 * Modulator types register through `registerModType`, so each type (LFO,
 * envelope, curve, S&H, sequencer) plugs in independently: defaults, the
 * settings-page controls, and a stateful `tick` that advances the signal.
 * A slot can instead point at an external source (a DSP app's own LFO or
 * follower) registered on the ModulationStore — same slot, same colours,
 * but the engine only mirrors the signal it is given.
