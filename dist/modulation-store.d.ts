/**
 * The modulation layer's runtime — a singleton beside the TweakStore.
 *
 * It owns the 16 slots, the control assignments, and the engine: one
 * self-halting requestAnimationFrame loop (the TimelineStore's pattern)
 * that advances every internal modulator and mirrors every external
 * source once per frame. Modulated values NEVER enter the TweakStore —
 * consumers pull them at frame time:
 *
 *   const speed = ModulationStore.getValue('fx', 'blob.speed');   // one path
 *   const params = ModulationStore.getValues('fx');               // whole panel
 *
 * Both return the stored base values with the live modulation applied on
 * top, clamped to each control's own bounds. Reading per frame is the
 * contract — nothing is pushed, so frame ordering stays in the app's hands.
 *
 * DSP apps whose modulators live on the audio side register them instead:
 *
 *   ModulationStore.registerSource('lfo-1', { sample: () => native.lfo1 });
 *   // or push at any rate: ModulationStore.setSourceValue('lfo-1', v);
 *
 * A slot pointing at a source shows its signal (circle, dots, step light)
 * but applies nothing to values unless the source says `applies: true` —
 * the app's own engine already did, at audio rate.
 *
 * The assignment gesture: touching a control (`noteTouch`, wired into the
 * panel and the bridge kit) arms it for a few seconds; a step-button press
 * (`assignFromStep`) then creates the slot's modulation if needed and
 * toggles the control onto it.
 *
 * Slots and assignments persist to localStorage (fail-soft, like panel
 * values), so a prototype's modulation setup survives a reload.
